# Java Design Patterns Demo

This project demonstrates six different software design patterns implemented in Java. Each pattern is showcased with a separate use case, highlighting its purpose and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## Design Patterns Covered

### 1. **Behavioral Design Patterns**
   - **Observer Pattern**: Demonstrates how an object (stock) notifies other objects (investors) of changes in its state.
     - File: `ObserverPatternDemo.java`
   - **Command Pattern**: Demonstrates how requests can be encapsulated as objects, allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests.
     - File: `CommandPatternDemo.java`

### 2. **Creational Design Patterns**
   - **Factory Pattern**: Demonstrates how object creation can be handled using a factory method to simplify the instantiation process.
     - File: `FactoryPatternDemo.java`
   - **Singleton Pattern**: Demonstrates how a class ensures that only one instance of itself is created and provides a global point of access to that instance.
     - File: `SingletonPatternDemo.java`

### 3. **Structural Design Patterns**
   - **Adapter Pattern**: Demonstrates how an interface can be adapted to work with different classes that would otherwise be incompatible.
     - File: `AdapterPatternDemo.java`
   - **Decorator Pattern**: Demonstrates how functionality can be dynamically added to an object using composition rather than inheritance.
     - File: `DecoratorPatternDemo.java`

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run each file to see the design pattern in action.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
